# compilers-lecture

This GIT repository contains a list of workshops and labs for compilers' design lecture. The level of complexity is for undergraduate students of computer science careers at ITESM university  

This is plan to be deliverable in a period of time of 4 to 6 months. It is adjustable in time and order; however the expectations and basic topics should keep the essence of the plan.
