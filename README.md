# compilers-lecture

This GIT repository contains a list of workshops and labs for compilers' design
lecture. The level of complexity is for undergraduate students of computer
science careers at ITESM university

This is plan to be deliverable in a period of time of 4 to 6 months. It is
adjustable in time and order; however the expectations and basic topics should
keep the essence of the plan.
